FE1 DOCUMENTATION COLLECTION

The appropiate modules are copyright Darrman, unless otherwise credited to any other user.
Do not claim those Nightmare Modules as your own, or I will request you to give credit and just get annoyed.
 Anyways, this file contains Nightmare Modules for Fire Emblem 1: Dark Dragon and the Sword of Light.
(Why doesn't anyone mention the "the", I don't know. Maybe it's cause of the raw Japanese.)
These assume the English patch is applied. It's not hard to find, check RHDN. To be more specific, it's the Quirino patch.

DISCLAIMER: IF YOUR ROM BREAKS, YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE. TESTED ONLY IN NM2. BEWARE, NM1 USERS, AS THESE ARE UNTESTED, AND MAY NOT WORK.
(2018 edit: The way I created some of the modules doesn't really play nice with NM1. Remember to strip off NM2 footers and purge .ini files frequently.

The folder should contain:
This file,
The old Readme (README-vincent),
The character editor containing the character editors and the growths editor.
Recruitment tables and the boss music list is there as well.
The class and promotion editors. Doga can become a general at last!
The translation patch is also included, as my module offsets assume the patch is applied.
Get the ROM yourself. Not like these tools can do anything without it.
The shop editors can edit shop data, but be aware many shops are tied to the same address.
The Item Editor can edit many properties, including weapon locks, since they're stored in the weapon level table. Death to the Miracle Sword Marth lock! 
The Enemy Editor can be used to modify the enemy items and position.
With patience, usage of Kirb's FE1 tileset in Tiled, and usage of the Map Pointer modules he made, custom chapters are creatable.
Speaking of notes, the notes I have compiled are included for reference.
They are quite detailed, though some may have been damaged by hard drive crashes.
I have also inserted the notes of Celice and his exploration of the game in years gone by.
These notes were essential for finding some of the findings here, and they should hopefully serve useful. 
Three table files are included. Basic FE1 has all the characters listed.
FE1Jp has the characters for the original Japanese version. FCEUX is stripped down to load in said emulator.
The ROM Map documents where most data in general is located throughout the ROM.
Finally, the Script Editor folder contains tools I used to dump and edit the script. I take no credit for them.
Both Atlas (the inserter) and Cartographer (the dumper) are freely available on Romhacking.net.

If there's anything else in this folder, I probably forgot to write it down.

Changelog:
V1.00: Who needs sensible version numbers? Added a *lot* of things.
V0.95: I finally found the enemy data, Chapter Unit Editors added.
Reinforcements are yet to be fully found, but they can wait for now.
There might be random other modules added in here and there too.
Some notes also added.

Also terrain data, maybe. That too.
