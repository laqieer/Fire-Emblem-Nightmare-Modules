Chapter 1 to 13 pointer table : $8010

Chapter 14 to 25 pointer table : $24010

The maps in question starts just after those two tables

note : pointers of table 1 only works on table 1 and same for table 2

0E 1F 00 10 (the rest of the map are the tiles in hex) 

This is chapter 1's map.what interests us here are the first 4 bytes

1st byte : y-size of the map
2nd byte : x-size of the map
3rd byte : starting camera's y-coordinates
4th byte : starting camera's x-coordinates

so the map is 1Fx0E(31*14)
and the camera starts at 10(16);0

minimum size in fe1
0E*0F
14*15
15*14
