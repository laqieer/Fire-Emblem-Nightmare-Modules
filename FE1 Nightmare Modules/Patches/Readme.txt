I have every FE1 patch that I am aware of here.
You might be asking what all these things are.
That's what explaining is for.
"FightSpeedASMHack" messes around with attack speed.
It does stuff like edit the double thresholds.
It was created by MasterKnightDH.
(Patch renamed to ASHack, it's shorter.)
"fe3ch3" was my April Fool's hack for 2018.
Can a bunch of FEU members clear the infamous level?
Created by yours truly.
(Patch renamed to Big Hill, the chapter's name in game.)
"MAFC3" was created for MAFC3. Its readme is also included.
Can Marth retrive his pants from that darn Navarre?
Created by yours truly.
(Patch renamed to Get the Pants, its in game name.)
"Mages with power" lets mages have functional attack.
20 magic mages now actually have 20 extra attack.
Created by yours truly.
(Patch renamed to Power, it's shorter.)
"Translation" speaks for itself.
Sure it's not great, but it beats Japanese.
Created by Quirino.
