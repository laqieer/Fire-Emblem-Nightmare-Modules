## Notes

Nightmare editor was first released by Hextator and he released its successor Nightmare 2. FEFNightmare was released as a successor of Nightmare 2 by thane98 and he released its successor Paragon. Their modules have different formats. Paragon's module format is so different that they are not collected in this repo. You can find them [here](https://github.com/thane98/paragon/tree/main/Data) instead.
