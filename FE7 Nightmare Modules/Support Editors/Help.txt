Custom Support Pointer Editor by Keriku

Ok, so I got bored, and I made this. Basically just put in your data, and the number on the right
(NOT LEFT) is your pointer for that. Be aware of all of the custom pointers you are using, or you
might right over other data! (Like Custom Battle Animation stuff.)

Any problems e-mail me at fireblazerwyvern@hotmail.com or post at FESS in the Coding and Hacking
section, in the FE 7 Editor post.
