Decompressing Text
-------------------

The game's script/text/dialog can all be found in the 'm' folder. You will find many files
that all have different parts of the game's text. For example, 'en_system' has tons of script data
pertaining to the general system, menus, names of things (such as characters and classes), and more.
The files with numbers attached to them correspond to the chapters of the game.

The game's text is compressed using LZ77, a basic type of compression. There are many programs to reverse this compression (these programs are commonly referred to as decompressors) such as NLZ77 Compressor, which I recommend for this process as it is the best program out there.

Choose the file whose text you want to decompress. Open up NLZ77 Compressor (included in this editor)
and in the "Input" select the file you want to decompress. For output, place it in some other folder
and name it whatever you want (preferably something that tells you what script/text the file contains).

Make sure "decompress" is selected and decompress the file. Now open up the decompressed file in a hex
editor with ASCII character editing support such as HxD or Cygnus (google them). You should now see
the game's text on the right of the hex editor (or wherever it shows the ASCII text). Congratulations,
you have successfully decompressed one of the text files of the game!
