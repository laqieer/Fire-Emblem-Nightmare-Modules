In the 'dwc' folder is a file called 'utility'. It's a binary file (has the extension .bin to be more specific) and it seems to contain programming data/ASM/misc. stuff and I think it's compressed with LZ77, but since hacking ASM and whatnot isn't really my priority, I'm not going to bother and see what this is and what it might affect. Best to leave the programming to the originals and the elite hackers, as I say! :D
