Class Sets Info
----------------

In the Class Editor module there is a slot for the different class sets. This edits which class set
the class is in. Any class in that class set can be switched to any other class in that class set.

For example, if you put the Lord (who normally can't class change) into set 1, he can change to any other
class in set 1. In addition, any other class in set 1 (like the Myrmidon, for instance) can also change
to the Lord class.

If you want to hack the game to not allow for class changes, you can do this by setting every class
to "none" so that they are not in any set and can't change to anybody, although the menu will still
be accessible (the player just can't change to any other class because there are no class sets).

Hope you enjoy editing the ReClass system!
