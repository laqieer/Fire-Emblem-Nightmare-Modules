How to Make Modules for Other Chapters
----------------------------------------

I don't have the time to create modules for every chapter, so here's how to make it yourself.
If someone wants to do this and then give me the modules so that I can share them with
everyone, then that'd be greatly appreciated...

Copy the Chapter 1 NMM (nightmare module) and rename it to whatever. Open the file
using a text editor and change the chapter # to whatever.

Where it says this:

1
Chapter 1 Unit Editor by Blazer
0x74
23
80
NULL
NULL

Edit the '23' part to however many units there are in that chapter. To find out how many unit
slots there are, go inside the unit data file (all the files are in the 'dispos' folder of
the game's data, named bmap### depending on the chapter) and go to offset 0x74.

Then go all the way until you reach the end of the unit data and you see some ASCII text.
Select all of the unit data there and find out how many bytes (in hex) you have selected.
Then take that #, use MS Calculator in Scientific Mode or some other hex calculator and type
in the # you just got (making sure you are in hex mode). Then divide that # by 0x50.
The result is how many unit entries/slots/whatever you want to call them there are in
a chapter's unit data file. =D
