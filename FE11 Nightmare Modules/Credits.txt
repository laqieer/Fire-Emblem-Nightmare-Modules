My online name is most commonly Blazer or Fire Blazer. It's somewhat of a lame nickname,
but I made it several years ago and it unfornuately stuck. I've been hacking for a long
while and I excel in Fire Emblem hacking, especially Fire Emblem 7 and Fire Emblem 11 [DS].
I made this editing package and wrote/created pretty much everything with it except for
the actual programs like Nightmare, Nintenlord's Compressor, Puyo Tools, etc.

If you use this at all to make a hack please give credit to me and the creators of the programs--I worked hard on this stuff and it's a time consuming, difficult job.

Thank you and I hope you find my Shadow Dragon Editor & Documentation to be useful.
Besides me, Blazer, whose contact details can be found at the end of this page, there are some other people who deserve some credit and mention here--

Nintenlord- His amazing utilities, patches, inspirations, and hacking discussions. Big thanks to NLZ77 compressor which is a must-have for FEDS editing. Same thing for GBA Graphics Editor, which works great with NDS too. Also, he even made a special program/add-on that can decompress FE11 portraits. This means that people can now hack FE11 portraits! Seriously, Nintenlord is THE man. He's a great person, too. Best of luck to him in the real world. :P

VincentASM- Help with locating data, answering questions, general hacking information, overall just some general help to get me started, he's a great person.

Iggy/Lute- Original page of data for FE7, which led to editors which inspired me to hack

Pukachi- Made first Nightmare editors, which inspired me to hack

Twilkitri- Indirectly and directly taught me about compressions, as well as his programs.

Arch- Very motivational and competitive, an awesome friend, hacker, and tested some patches for me.
Also made the Item List and helped with some other lists.


Motivational~
--------------
Seraphinox & Lusty- Friends of mine who if not for them, I probably would not care about Fire Emblem.
FES Forums- Motivation, fun chats, and more-- seriously, if I'm not motivated, I don't get anything done.
Shadowofchaos72, DH_Ninja, Felover3, Ryrumeli, TheDangerDan23, - Motivation and listening to my rants. felover3 helped me obtain FEDS before it even came out. These people are -pretty- good friends... XP

Everybody who has ever motivated me or thanked me for the small and useless things I've done.
