Shadow Dragon Editor & Doc by Blazer
-------------------------------------

Please read the text files before contacting me, getting frustrated, giving up, etc.

I've put up plenty of documentation and notes for people who want to hack and otherwise I've
written plenty of guides and tutorials telling how to work pretty much each and every thing
there is in this editing package. The editors aren't done and some guides and stuff may
be outdated or incorrect or something, please excuse that.

But do read the files that are around here--learn how to decompile your ROM and then
get the basic Nightmare stuff going, using the READMEs and other guides to help you.
Then you can go on and try harder stuff like text and graphic editing and if you need
any help, post on the Fire Emblem Shrine forums at http://forums.feshrine.net or contact
me somewhere else.

And besides me, Blazer, don't forget about the other people who helped with this,
all mentioned in the Credits text file.

Good luck and have a good time hacking!
