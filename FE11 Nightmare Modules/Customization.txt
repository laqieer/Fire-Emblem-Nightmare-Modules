As time is a limited resource these days, I did not add evrything to the effects.

If you want a special effect like a weapon making you invincible and being a brave weapon simultanously,
just take the two values (0x40000 for invincibility and 0x200 for Brave Effect) and add them together
(so 0x40200 for invincibility and brave effect). 

Obviously, you can combine as many effects as you want.

Just keep in mind that these are all in hex, so 0x600 (Brave Magic Weapon) + 0x800 (Uncounterable Weapon) is not 0x14000 but
0xE00 (Uncounterable Brave Magic Weapon). (Use a calculator if necessary)

After you have combined the bytes open "Effect 3.txt" in a text editor. Add yur new value to the list.

After that, go to the top of the text-file. You'll see a number in the first line. 35 should be the default
(it could be higher if you/someone already edited the file). This number tells Nightmare how many entries there are in
the dropdown box when editing the database in Nightmare. If there are more entries than this number's value, the simply
won't show up.
Now, if you just added one value to the list, add one to the number at the top, for two values two for three three and so on.
Be aware that this number is NOT in hex, so you adding 6 to 35 is 41 and not 3B!

Customization is also possible with class abilites and more. Then you'll have to edit other text files, but it essentially the same thing as it is with items.

Have Fun making broken items
