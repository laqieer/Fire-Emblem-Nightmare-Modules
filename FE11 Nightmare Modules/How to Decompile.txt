Fire Emblem DS Hacking Compilation by Blazer

How to Decompile your NDS ROM

1) Obtain the game. I cannot help you do this.
2) Obtain a program to decompile your game. I recommend DSlazy because it is simple.
If it does not work, make sure you have installed the .NET runtime.
3) Use your program and either load your ROM. For DSlazy, this means using the "..." button on the left side
and choosing your NDS game.
4) Hit "unpack" or "decompile". Wait a couple of minutes for the thing to do it's stuff.
5) Go to the place where the decompiled ROM is. For DSlazy, go to the folder with DSlazy and then go to
"NDS_UNPACK".
6) There are two folders from here. You will almost always use the "data" folder, unless mentioned otherwise.
7) In the data folder are bunch of other folders with tons of files. If this is what you have, then you have successfully decompiled your game. ^_^

How to Recompile your NDS ROM

1) For DSlazy, simply hit "nds packer" and then choose what to save your packed game as.
For others, hit something like 'recompile' or 'repack', and normally that will do it.

How to edit the files in a decompiled ROM

1) Open up your hex editor.
2) Open up the file you want to edit.
3) You can now edit the data just like that; however, it may prove hard as the data is usually compressed.
To decompress and compress LZ77 data, see the LZ77 Compression guide. Not ALL data is LZ77. There
are many compressions. I cannot help you with everything. See the documentation for information
about individual files and folders.
